    <h2>Designing Games & Gameplay</h2>

    <p>
      I'm currently working at ION Game Design overseeing an unannounced project based on one of the many board games ION has to offer. My focus in this project is project management and Game & Level-design. No project is too small or too large to not benefit from good game design and I strive to adapt my design decisions based on the scope of the project and what is needed to convey to the player. This design is what helps bring the collective efforts of a team together to a finished product and works as the glue of the project, much like myself when working in a team. Just as it is important that the design does what it needs to, it is of equal importance that it works in harmony with the pieces provided by other members of the team. I enjoy the challenge of making the design work with elements that seemingly lack cohesion but are, nevertheless, brought to work through a thoroughly thought through design choice.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'd be happy to contribute with my diligent work ethic to any project and equally happy to work towards harmonizing the game development process between teams and team members.

      If you'd like to collaborate or know more about the projects I'm involved with, just send me a message!
